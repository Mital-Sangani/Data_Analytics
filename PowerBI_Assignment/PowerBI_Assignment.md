###### **1) What is Power BI?**

Power BI is a powerful Business Intelligence and Data Visualization tool made by Microsoft.

It helps users connect to different data sources, clean and prepare data, and create beautiful interactive reports and dashboards.

It is used to understand data better and make smart business decisions.


Difference between Power BI and Excel:

Power BI:

Specially made for data analysis and visualization
Creates attractive and interactive dashboards
Handles large amount of data easily (millions of rows)
Connects to live data from cloud, databases, and many sources
Can automatically refresh data
Easy online sharing of reports

Excel:

Mostly used for calculations and small data analysis
Basic charts and graphs (less interactive)
Slows down with very large data
Mostly works with files stored locally or on cloud
Updates are mostly done manually
File sharing is through email or cloud


Simple understanding:

Excel is good for small calculations and data analysis.

Power BI is best for creating beautiful, interactive, and real-time dashboards from large data.


=========================================================================================================================================



###### **2) Concept of Data Modeling in Power BI**


Data Modeling in Power BI means organizing and connecting different tables of data in a logical way so that they work together for analysis.

It is the process of creating relationships between tables, defining calculations, and preparing data for reporting.

In Power BI, data modeling is done in the Model View, where you can:

Connect tables using relationships (example: linking "Orders" table with "Customers" table using Customer ID).

Create calculated columns and measures using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions).

Organize data into a structure that makes it easy to create visuals and reports.

Reduce duplicate data by using a star schema or snowflake schema design.


Why data modeling is important in Power BI:

Makes data analysis faster and easier.
Avoids errors and confusion in reports.
Improves report performance.
Allows complex calculations and insights.


Simple understanding:

Data Modeling is like creating a map of your data so that Power BI knows how different tables are connected and can give correct results in dashboards.


=========================================================================================================================================


###### **3) Types of Connections in Power BI**


In Power BI, there are mainly two types of connections used to connect to data sources:

1\. Import Mode

Data is copied from the source and stored inside the Power BI file (.pbix).
Reports are faster because data is loaded from the local Power BI model.
Needs refresh to get updated data from the source.
Best for small or medium datasets.


2\. DirectQuery Mode

Data stays in the original source and is not stored in Power BI.
Every time you view or filter the report, Power BI directly queries the source.
Always shows the latest data without manual refresh.
Best for very large datasets but performance depends on the source speed.
Other connection options in Power BI:

Live Connection → Connects directly to online services like Azure Analysis Services or SQL Server Analysis Services.

Composite Model → Allows using both Import and DirectQuery in the same report.


Simple understanding:

Import Mode = Take a photo of the data and store it in Power BI.

DirectQuery Mode = Keep the data at the source and check it live whenever needed.


=========================================================================================================================================


###### **4) Handling Data Transformation in Power BI**

Data transformation in Power BI means cleaning, shaping, and preparing raw data so that it becomes ready for analysis.

This is done using the Power Query Editor in Power BI.

Steps to handle data transformation:

Load Data into Power BI

Connect to the required data source (Excel, database, cloud, etc.).

Open Power Query Editor

Click on "Transform Data" to open the editor.

Clean the Data

Remove unwanted rows or columns.

Handle missing values (replace or remove).

Remove duplicates.

Shape the Data

Rename columns for better understanding.

Change data types (text, number, date, etc.).

Filter specific rows.

Transform the Data

Merge or append tables.

Create calculated columns.

Pivot or unpivot data.

Apply Changes

Click "Close \& Apply" to load the transformed data into Power BI.


Simple understanding:

Data transformation in Power BI is like cleaning and arranging your messy room before showing it to guests — here, the “guests” are your visuals and reports.


=========================================================================================================================================


###### **5) What is DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) and why is it important in Power BI?**


DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) is a formula language used in Power BI, Power Pivot, and Analysis Services to create custom calculations and expressions.

It is similar to Excel formulas but is designed to work with data models and relationships.

Key uses of DAX in Power BI:

Create calculated columns (extra columns based on formulas).
Create measures (calculations like sum, average, percentage, etc.).
Perform time-based calculations (Year-to-Date, Month-to-Date, etc.).
Apply complex business logic in reports.

Why DAX is important:

Helps in creating powerful and dynamic reports.
Allows users to perform calculations on large datasets.
Makes reports interactive and meaningful.
Enables advanced data analysis beyond simple charts.


Simple understanding:

DAX is like the “brain” of Power BI — it thinks, calculates, and gives answers to your data questions. Without DAX, Power BI visuals would only show basic information.


=========================================================================================================================================


###### **6) Difference between Calculated Columns and Measures in Power BI**


1. Calculated Column → Works row by row, values stored in the table.
   Measure → Works on aggregated data, values calculated on the fly.


2. Calculated Column → Takes more memory as values are stored.
   Measure → More memory-efficient.


3. Calculated Column → Used when you need the result in every row.
   Measure → Used when you only need the result in visuals.


Simple understanding:

Calculated column is like adding a new fixed column in your notebook.

Measure is like doing a quick calculation on the spot when someone asks you a question.


=========================================================================================================================================



###### **7) Handling Relationships Between Tables in Power BI**


In Power BI, relationships connect tables so that data from different tables can work together in reports.

For example, linking a “Sales” table with a “Customers” table using the “Customer ID” field.

Steps to handle relationships in Power BI:

Load all required tables into Power BI.
Go to the Model View to see all tables.
Drag a field (like Customer ID) from one table to the matching field in another table to create a relationship.
Choose the relationship type (One-to-Many, Many-to-One, One-to-One, Many-to-Many).
Set cross-filter direction (Single or Both) based on how you want filters to work.
If needed, edit or delete relationships from the "Manage Relationships" option.

Types of relationships:

One-to-One (1:1) → Each row in Table A matches exactly one row in Table B.

One-to-Many (1:\*) → One row in Table A matches multiple rows in Table B.

Many-to-One (\*:1) → Many rows in Table A match one row in Table B. (Opposite of One-to-Many)

Many-to-Many (:) → Multiple rows in both tables can match each other.


Why relationships are important:

Combine data from multiple tables.
Avoid duplicate data.
Make analysis easier and faster.


Simple understanding:

Relationships in Power BI are like making connections between friends in different groups so they can share information with each other.


=========================================================================================================================================



###### **8) What is the purpose of a Power BI Gateway?**


A Power BI Gateway is a bridge between on-premises data (data stored in your local network or company servers) and the Power BI Service (cloud).

It allows Power BI to access and refresh data from local sources without moving the data permanently to the cloud.


Purpose of Power BI Gateway:

Securely connect local data sources to the cloud.
Enable scheduled data refresh for reports using on-premises data.
Support both Import mode and DirectQuery mode connections.
Ensure data privacy and security during transfer.


Simple understanding:

Power BI Gateway works like a “secure door” that allows Power BI in the cloud to talk to your local data without moving it outside your network.


=========================================================================================================================================


###### **9) How can you schedule data refresh in Power BI Service?**


Scheduling data refresh in Power BI Service helps keep your reports and dashboards updated automatically without manual effort.

Steps to schedule a data refresh:

Publish your report from Power BI Desktop to Power BI Service.
In Power BI Service, go to the workspace where the dataset is located.
Click on the More options (…) next to your dataset and select Settings.
Under Scheduled Refresh, turn it ON.
Set the refresh frequency (Daily or Weekly) and choose the time slots.
Enter the required data source credentials if needed.
Save the settings.


Simple understanding:

Scheduling data refresh is like setting an alarm clock for your data — it wakes up at a fixed time and updates itself automatically.


=========================================================================================================================================


###### **10) Explain the concept of Row-Level Security in Power BI**


Row-Level Security (RLS) in Power BI is a feature that restricts data access for certain users based on filters.

It ensures that each user only sees the data they are allowed to see.


How it works:

You define roles and set DAX filter rules for those roles.
When a user is assigned to a role, Power BI automatically applies the filter whenever they open the report.


Example: A sales manager for the "North" region will only see sales data for the North region, not other regions.

Benefits of RLS:

Improves data security.

Makes reports personalized for each user.
Avoids creating multiple reports for different users.

Simple understanding:

RLS is like giving each person a pair of glasses that only lets them see their own part of the data.


=========================================================================================================================================


###### **11) What is Power BI Desktop and how does it differ from Power BI Service?**


Power BI Desktop:

A free application installed on your computer.
Used to connect to data sources, clean and model data, create visuals, and build reports.
Works offline.
You can publish reports from Power BI Desktop to Power BI Service.


Power BI Service:

An online (cloud-based) platform accessed through a web browser.
Used to view, share, and collaborate on reports and dashboards.
Supports scheduled data refresh, sharing, and Row-Level Security.
Works online only.


Main Differences:


Power BI Desktop → For creating and designing reports.

Power BI Service → For sharing, viewing, and collaborating on reports.

Power BI Desktop → Offline tool.

Power BI Service → Online cloud platform.

Power BI Desktop → Free to use.

Power BI Service → Requires a Power BI Pro or Premium license for sharing.


Simple understanding:

Power BI Desktop is like a kitchen where you prepare the food (reports), and Power BI Service is like a restaurant where people come to eat (view and use reports).


==========================================================================================================================================


###### **12) Explain the concept of DirectQuery in Power BI**


DirectQuery is a connection mode in Power BI where the data stays in the original source, and Power BI retrieves it in real-time whenever a report is viewed.

No data is imported or stored inside the Power BI file.


Key points about DirectQuery:

Always shows the latest data from the source.
Useful for large datasets that cannot be imported.
Performance depends on the speed of the source system.
Supports Row-Level Security.


Simple understanding:

DirectQuery is like checking your bank balance online — you don’t store the data, you see it live from the source every time.


==========================================================================================================================================



###### **13) What are Power BI Templates and how are they useful?**


Power BI Templates (.pbit) are files that store the structure of a report without the actual data.

They include report layouts, visuals, queries, data model, and measures, but not the dataset.

Uses of Power BI Templates:

Share report designs without sharing confidential data.
Reuse the same report structure with different datasets.
Save time in report creation.


Simple understanding:

A Power BI Template is like an empty cake mold — you can use it again and again to make cakes (reports) with different ingredients (data).


==========================================================================================================================================


###### **14) How do you handle incremental data refresh in Power BI?**


Incremental data refresh means updating only the new or changed data instead of reloading the entire dataset every time.

Steps to handle incremental refresh:

Prepare your table with a date/time column to identify new or updated records.
In Power BI Desktop, go to Modeling → Incremental Refresh.
Set the range of data to keep and how often to refresh it.
Publish the report to Power BI Service.
Enable scheduled refresh.


Benefits:

Saves time.
Reduces load on data sources.
Improves report performance.

Simple understanding:

Incremental refresh is like updating only the new episodes in your TV series download instead of downloading the whole series again.


==========================================================================================================================================



###### **15) What is the role of Power Query in Power BI?**


Power Query is a data connection and transformation tool in Power BI.

It is used to clean, shape, and prepare data before loading it into the data model.


Main roles of Power Query:

Connect to various data sources.
Remove duplicates and errors.
Change data types.
Merge or append tables.
Apply custom transformations.


Simple understanding:

Power Query is like a washing machine for your data — it cleans and prepares it so that Power BI can use it for reports.



==========================================================================================================================================



###### **16) Difference between Calculated Columns and Calculated Tables in Power BI**


Calculated Columns:


Created within an existing table using a DAX formula.
Works on a row-by-row basis.
Stores results for each row in the table.


Example: Adding a "Total = Price × Quantity" column to a Sales table.


Calculated Tables:

A new table created using a DAX formula.
Can be based on existing tables, filtered data, or combined data.
Useful for creating lookup tables or summary tables.


Example: Creating a table of only high-value customers from the main Customers table.

Simple understanding:

Calculated column = Adding a new column inside an existing table.

Calculated table = Creating a completely new table from scratch or from existing tables.


==========================================================================================================================================


###### **17) How do you create custom visuals in Power BI?**


Custom visuals are user-designed charts or visuals that go beyond the default visuals provided by Power BI.

Steps to create custom visuals:

Go to Visualizations Pane and click Get more visuals.
Search for the desired visual from the AppSource store.
Click Add to import it into your report.
Use it like any other visual in Power BI.


For developers:

Use the Power BI Developer Tools (Node.js + TypeScript) to build custom visuals from scratch.


Simple understanding:

Creating custom visuals is like adding new toppings to your pizza — it makes your report more attractive and unique.



==========================================================================================================================================



###### **18) Best practices for optimizing performance in Power BI**


Use Import mode for faster reports when possible.
Reduce the number of columns and rows loaded.
Use star schema instead of complex relationships.
Create measures instead of calculated columns where possible.
Enable incremental refresh for large datasets.
Avoid complex DAX formulas in visuals.
Use aggregations for very large datasets.


==========================================================================================================================================


###### **19) How can you integrate Power BI with other Microsoft products like Azure and Office 365?**


Integration examples:

Azure: Connect to Azure SQL Database, Azure Data Lake, or Azure Synapse Analytics for live data analysis.

Office 365: Embed Power BI reports in Microsoft Teams or SharePoint for easy collaboration.

Excel: Export Power BI data to Excel or import Excel tables into Power BI.

Power Automate: Automate workflows based on Power BI alerts.


Simple understanding:

Power BI works like a team player with other Microsoft tools, sharing data and insights across platforms.


==========================================================================================================================================


###### **20) Explain the concept of aggregations in Power BI**


Aggregations in Power BI are pre-calculated summaries of data that make large datasets faster to analyze.

Benefits of aggregations:

Improve report speed.
Reduce the amount of data loaded into memory.
Work well with DirectQuery for large datasets.


Example:

Instead of loading every transaction, load only the total sales per month — queries run much faster.


==========================================================================================================================================


###### **21) How do you handle error handling and data quality in Power BI?**


Handling errors:


Use Power Query to remove errors from columns.
Replace missing or null values.
Filter out invalid data during transformation.


Improving data quality:

Check for duplicates and remove them.
Correct data types (text, date, number).
Validate data using DAX calculations.


Simple understanding:

Handling data quality in Power BI is like proofreading your homework — fix mistakes before showing it to others.


==========================================================================================================================================



###### **22) What is the purpose of Power BI Embedded and when would you use it?**


Power BI Embedded is a service that allows developers to embed Power BI reports and dashboards into their own applications or websites.


Purpose:

Provide analytics and visual reports inside custom apps.
Share insights with customers without giving them access to Power BI Service.


When to use:

When building a customer-facing app that needs interactive reports.
When you want analytics in your product without requiring users to have a Power BI license.


Simple understanding:

Power BI Embedded is like putting a mini Power BI inside your own app so users can see reports without opening Power BI separately.
