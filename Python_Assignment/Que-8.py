# What is the purpose continuing statement in python?

"""

*** purpose ***

The continue statement loops me use hota he vo current iteration ko skip karta he aur next iteration pe jump karta he

Example:
  
for i in range(1, 6):
    if i == 3:
        continue  # Skip the iteration when i is 3
    print(i)

    output: 1
            2
            4
            5

    explanation:
        * When i == 3, the continue statement executes.
        * The loop skips the print(i) statement and jumps to the next iteration.
        * The numbers 1, 2, 4, 5 are printed, but 3 is skipped.
