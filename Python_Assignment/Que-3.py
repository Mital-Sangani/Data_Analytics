"""


● Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics.

** devpleped by : "guido van rossum" (in end of 1980) but released : 1991

● Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it 
  very attractive for Rapid Application Development.

● Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse.

● The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form 
  without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.


                              meanings of words:

* Interpreted: Python code is executed line by line, making it easy to debug.

* Object-Oriented: Supports object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts like classes and objects.

* High-Level: Abstracts complex low-level operations, making it easy to read and write.

* Dynamic Semantics: Variables do not need explicit declaration, and types are determined at runtime.

* Extensive Libraries: Comes with a vast standard library for various applications (e.g., NumPy, Pandas,
  TensorFlow).

* Cross-Platform: Runs on Windows, macOS, Linux, etc.

* Easy Syntax: Uses indentation for readability, making it beginner-friendly.
