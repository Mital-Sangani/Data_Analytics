# What is List? How will you reverse a list? 

"""
A list in Python is a collection of items that are:

✔ Ordered (Items have a specific order)
✔ Mutable (We can change, add, or remove items)
✔ Allow duplicates (Same value can appear multiple times)

1. Ordered: The order of elements is maintained.

2. Mutable: You can modify, add, or remove elements after the list is created.

3. Heterogeneous: A list can contain elements of different types (integers, strings, floats, 
etc.).

4. Indexed: You can access elements using their index, with support for negative indexing.

5. Iterable: You can loop through the elements of a list using a for loop



We use square brackets [] to define a list.

fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"]
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40]
mixed = ["Hello", 3.14, True]  # List with different data types


============================================================================================

there are multiple ways to reverse a list:

1. Using reverse() : If you want to modify the original list 
2. Using Slicing [::-1] : If you want a new reversed list 
3. Using reversed() : If you need an iterator for large datasets
